Student Management System (React + Node + MongoDB)
This is a full-stack Student Management application built to manage student records easily. The application allows users to add, view, update, and delete students, with all data stored securely in MongoDB.

This project was created to practice real-world full-stack development, API integration, and responsive UI design.
